ACTION_ID:
22

ACTION_NAME:
bottom_rest

CONTEXT:
UNDERWATER — the turtle is suspended in water, nothing supports it. Legs are spread and paddle, toes spread. Do NOT draw water.

DESCRIPTION:
Resting (or sleeping) on the bottom of the water. Plastron on the bottom, neck stretched forward, legs relaxed.

==================================================
1. FRAME SEQUENCE
==================================================

FRAME 1:
Lying on the bottom, neck stretched forward, eyes half closed.

FRAME 2:
Head lifts very slightly.

FRAME 3:
Head lifted a little more, as if checking around.

FRAME 4:
Head settles back down.

LOOP: Frame 4 must lead naturally back into Frame 1.

The four frames must clearly belong to the SAME continuous movement.

==================================================
2. THREE VIEWS
==================================================

Every column shows the SAME moment from three cameras.

FRONT:
In front of the turtle, camera ABOVE looking DOWN about 45 degrees. Face toward the viewer, symmetric.

SIDE:
Turtle faces RIGHT, camera at roughly eye level. Never draw it facing left.

BACK:
Behind the turtle, camera ABOVE looking DOWN about 45 degrees. Tail toward the viewer, face never visible.

==================================================
3. SPRITE SHEET
==================================================

Create exactly ONE raw sprite sheet: 3 rows × 4 columns = 12 cells.

Row 1 = FRONT (45 degrees from above)
Row 2 = SIDE (facing right)
Row 3 = BACK (45 degrees from above)

Column 1–4 = Frame 1–4.

The labels above are INTERNAL ORGANIZATION ONLY.
Do NOT draw labels, numbers, titles, grid lines or borders.

Exactly ONE complete turtle per cell.
Same turtle size in every cell.
Leave clear magenta space between rows.

==================================================
4. ANATOMY
==================================================

Exactly ONE head, ONE neck, ONE long tapered tail and FOUR legs in every cell.
The shell is rigid: never squash, stretch or bend it.
No motion blur, no speed lines, no ghost copies, no chibi deformation.

==================================================
5. BACKGROUND
==================================================

Solid flat magenta, exact RGB 255, 0, 255, one single colour across the whole image.
No water, ground, bubbles, shadows, plants, rocks, props or effects.
The turtle is the ONLY visible object.
